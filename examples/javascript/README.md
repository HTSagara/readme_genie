**Server Application with Express.js**
==================================

Overview
---------------

This is a simple server application built using Node.js and Express.js. The application listens on port 3000 and provides two routes: `/api/greet/:name` and `/api/farewell`.

Getting Started
---------------

1. Install Node.js and npm (if you haven't already).
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
4. Run `node server.js` to start the server.
5. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/api/greet/<YourName>` to test the greeting route. Replace `<YourName>` with your desired name.

Features
--------------

### Greeting Route

The `/api/greet/:name` route accepts a GET request and returns a personalized greeting message. The `:name` parameter is extracted from the request URL and used to construct the greeting message.

### Farewell Route

The `/api/farewell` route accepts a POST request and returns a personalized farewell message. The `name` parameter is extracted from the request body and used to construct the farewell message.

Setup
--------------

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (version 14 or later)
* npm (version 6 or later)

### Dependency Installation

Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.

### Configuration

No configuration is required for this application.

### Launching the Server

Run `node server.js` to start the server.

### Testing the Application

Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/api/greet/<YourName>` to test the greeting route. Replace `<YourName>` with your desired name.

### Debugging

In case of any issues, you can check the server logs for errors. You can also use tools like npm's built-in `--verbose` flag or a logging library like Winston to enable verbose logging.
