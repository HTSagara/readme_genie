## Introduction

This project consists of two files, `main_example.py` and `classes.py`. The `main_example.py` file uses the `classes.py` file to gather input from the user to create instances of the `Greeting` and `Farewell` classes, and then print out the corresponding greeting and farewell messages.

## How to Use

To use this project, follow these steps:
1. Ensure that you are operating in an environment where Python scripts can be executed.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the `main_example.py` and `classes.py` files. You can use the `cd` command to navigate to the correct directory.
4. Type `python main_example.py` and press Enter to run the `main_example.py` file.

## Examples

Here is an example of how the output might look like when executing the `main_example.py` file. 
```
Enter your name: Alice
Hello, Alice!

Goodbye, Alice!
```

The input above shows the user entering the name "Alice" and the script outputting the greeting "Hello, Alice!" and the farewell "Goodbye, Alice!"

By modifying the input name, you can generate different combinations of greetings and farewells for each execution of the script. 

Note that this is just one example of how to use the provided code and integrate it into a larger project. The flexibility of this structure allows you to customize and expand upon this foundation to create more complex and innovative applications.
