## Introduction

This project consists of two files, `main_example.py` and `classes.py`. The `main_example.py` file runs the program and uses classes defined in the `classes.py` file. The `classes.py` file contains two classes, `Greeting` and `Farewell`, which are used to greet and farewell users with personalized messages. The `main_example.py` file uses an input prompt to gather a user's name, constructs instances of the `Greeting` and `Farewell` classes that utilize this name, and then outputs the resulting personalized greeting and farewell messages.

## How to Use

To use this project, follow these steps:
1. Ensure that you are operating in a Python environment that supports modules and classes, as this project depends on those features.
2. Copy both the `main_example.py` and `classes.py` files to your working directory.
3. Modify the `classes.py` file to personalize the `Greeting` and `Farewell` class prototypes, making sure to adjust the say_hello() and say_goodbye() methods to meet your specific needs.
4. Save your changes and navigate to the directory containing the two files.
5. Run the `main_example.py` file using your preferred Python interpreter.

## Examples

Example usage of the `main_example.py` file:
```python
# main_example.py
from classes import Greeting, Farewell

def main():
    name = input("Enter your name: ")

    greeting = Greeting(name)
    farewell = Farewell(name)

    print(greeting.say_hello())
    print(farewell.say_goodbye())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Example usage of the `classes.py` file:
```python
# classes.py
class Greeting:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def say_hello(self):
        return f"Hello, {self.name}!"

class Farewell:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def say_goodbye(self):
        return f"Goodbye, {self.name}!"
```

These examples demonstrate how to use the provided code to create personalized greetings and farewells for a user. 

Note: You can further customize the `classes.py` file to expand the variety of greetings and farewells or even create entirely new classes with distinct functionalities. Additionally, this project serves as a foundation for constructing more intricate applications using object-oriented programming concepts.
