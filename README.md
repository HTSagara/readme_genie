**ReadmeGenie: A Tool for Generating README.md Files using Groq**
==============================================================

ReadmeGenie is a command-line tool that uses Groq's language model to generate a detailed README.md file from a set of input files. The tool provides flexibility in terms of input file selection, API key setup, and output filename.

**Getting Started**
---------------

Before using ReadmeGenie, please ensure you have the following:

1. Install the required Python packages: `groq` and `envdot`
2. Create a Groq API key and base URL (see [Groq API Documentation](https://groq.com/docs/api) for more information)

**Usage**
-----

To use ReadmeGenie, run the following command:

```
python readmegenie.py [options] <file1> <file2> ...
```

Replace `<file1> <file2> ...` with the paths to the input files you want to use for generating the README.md file.

**Options**
-------

The following options are available:

* `-a` or `--api-key`: Specify your Groq API key. If not provided, the tool will look for it in a `.env` file.
* `-u` or `--base-url`: Specify the base URL for the Groq API. If not provided, the tool will default to `https://api.groq.com` or use the value from a `.env` file.
* `-o` or `--output`: Specify the output filename for the generated README.md file. Default is `README.md`.
* `-v` or `--version`: Show the tool version and exit.

**Example Usage**
-------------

 Generate a README.md file from a set of input files using the command:

```
python readmegenie.py -a MY_GROQ_API_KEY -u https://api.groq.com input_file1.txt input_file2.txt
```

In this example, ReadmeGenie will generate a README.md file based on the contents of `input_file1.txt` and `input_file2.txt` using the provided API key and base URL. The output filename will be `README.md`.

**Notes**
----

* The tool will create a `.env` file in the current working directory if it does not exist and the API key is provided.
* If you want to use a different API key or base URL for future runs, you can edit the `.env` file or update the API key and base URL using the `-a` and `-u` options.
* If you encounter any issues during the execution, the tool will print an error message with details.
