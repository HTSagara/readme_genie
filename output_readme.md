**Complexity Analysis Program**
=================================

This is a simple Python program to demonstrate complexity analysis.

**Functions**
-------------

### calculate_factorial(n)

Calculates the factorial of a given number `n`. The function uses a recursive approach to compute the factorial.

### is_prime(num)

Checks whether a given number `num` is prime. The function uses a iterative approach to check for primality.

**Usage**
-----

To run the program, simply execute the Python script. The program will calculate the factorial of 5 and check if 11 is a prime number, printing the results to the console.

**Notes**
-----

* This program is for educational purposes only, demonstrating basic concepts in complexity analysis.
* The `is_prime` function has a time complexity of O(n), which can be improved using more efficient algorithms.

**Dependencies**
-------------

* Python 3.x
