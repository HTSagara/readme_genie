**Introduction**
----------------

Welcome to the `main_example.py` and `classes.py` project! This project provides a simple demonstration of how to create and use classes in Python. The `main_example.py` file demonstrates how to use the classes defined in `classes.py` to generate personalized greetings and farewells.

**How to Use**
----------------

To use this project, simply run the `main_example.py` file using Python. Here's how:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the `main_example.py` file.
2. Run the file using the command `python main_example.py`.
3. The script will prompt you to enter your name.
4. Enter your name and press Enter.
5. The script will print a personalized greeting and farewell message using your name.

**Examples**
------------

Here is an example of what the output will look like:

```
Enter your name: John
Hello, John!
Goodbye, John!
```

**Explanation**
--------------

The `main_example.py` file uses the classes defined in `classes.py` to create instances of a `Greeting` and a `Farewell` object. The `Greeting` class has an `__init__` method that takes a `name` parameter, which is stored as an instance variable. The `say_hello` method returns a greeting message that includes the `name` instance variable.

Similarly, the `Farewell` class has an `__init__` method that also takes a `name` parameter, which is stored as an instance variable. The `say_goodbye` method returns a farewell message that includes the `name` instance variable.

In the `main` function, we create instances of the `Greeting` and `Farewell` classes using the `input` function to get the user's name. We then call the `say_hello` and `say_goodbye` methods to print out the personalized messages.

**Conclusion**
--------------

This project demonstrates a simple example of how to create and use classes in Python. By using the classes defined in `classes.py`, we can create instances of `Greeting` and `Farewell` objects and use their methods to generate personalized messages. Enjoy exploring the world of Python classes!
