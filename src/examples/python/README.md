**Introduction**

This repository contains a simple Python script that demonstrates the basics of object-oriented programming by defining two classes: `Greeting` and `Farewell`.

### Greeting

The `Greeting` class is used to create objects that offer a personalized greeting. It has the following properties and methods:
* Property: `name`: The name of the person to whom the greeting is addressed.

* Method: `say_goodbye()`: Returns a farewell message in the format `"Goodbye, [name]!"`.

**Using the Classes**
